### Hello there 👋

I'm currently attempting to master the art of backend coding with a focus on AI development, one bug at a time 😉.

I hold a **BSc in Physics** from **[Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat)** and am a current **MSc in Data Science** student at **[Universitat Oberta de Catalunya](https://www.uoc.edu)**.

I'm mostly interested in **Graph Theory** and **Graph Neural Networks** research.
